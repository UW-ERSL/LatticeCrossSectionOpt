## Overview

This work presents a data-driven framework for optimizing lattice beam cross-sections under linear elastic loading. Beam cross-sections are parameterized using B-spline curves and optimized in a learned latent space obtained via a variational autoencoder (VAE).

Direct optimization in the B-spline space is challenging due to high dimensionality and geometric validity constraints. To address this, a VAE is trained on datasets of both valid and invalid cross-section shapes, enabling it to implicitly learn manufacturable geometries. The resulting latent space is smooth, low-dimensional, and well-suited for gradient-based optimization.

Optimized latent variables are decoded back into B-spline representations and used to generate watertight STL files for additive manufacturing, enabling a fully digital design-to-production workflow.

## Workflow

The framework consists of two primary stages:

---

### 1. Data Generation and VAE Training

Use `trainVAE.py` to generate cross-section datasets and train the variational autoencoder.

This script allows you to:
- Define B-spline geometry parameters:
  - Number of control points (`n_cp`)
  - Spline degree (`k`)
- Generate datasets containing both valid and invalid cross-section shapes
- Specify VAE architecture and training parameters
- Train a VAE that maps B-spline control points and cross-section properties to a compact latent space

**Output:**  
A trained VAE model whose decoder produces valid, manufacturable B-spline cross-sections.

### 2. Lattice Optimization Using a Trained VAE

Latent-space optimization is performed using `optBeam.ipynb`.

This notebook allows you to:
- Load a previously trained VAE model
- Define structural optimization problems:
  - Single beams
  - Three beams
  - Lattice structures
  - More
- Specify boundary conditions, loading, and volume constraints
- Perform gradient-based optimization directly in the latent space
- Decode optimized latent variables into B-spline cross-sections
- Automatically generate watertight STL files suitable for 3D printing

Example problems are provided and can be easily extended to custom geometries and loading conditions.
